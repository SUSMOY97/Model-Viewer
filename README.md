# Model-Viewer
Implementation of Model Viewer in the Web.

Model Viewer is an easy approach to render 3D models to the web and PWA's. Different Animations,Camera positions,shadow effects can be implemented by just adding a specific attribiute to the Model Viewer.

Model Viewer can trigger AR core Scene Viewer but just adding an attribute 'ar' to the model-viewer. It can easily handle all the complexity for us!
